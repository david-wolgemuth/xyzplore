#### Data Representation - YAML, SQL, JavaScript

The following code snippets provide examples of how the plant data could be represented in different formats, such as YAML, SQL, and JavaScript:



```yaml
plants:
  - name: "Common Eastern Bumblebee"
    colors: ["green", "purple"]
    shape: "spherical, thistle-like"
  - name: "Broad-winged Thistle"
    colors: ["green", "purple"]
    shape: "spiky, spherical"
  - name: "Johnsongrasses, millet"
    colors: ["green", "brown"]
    shape: "thin, elongated"
  - name: "Poeae"
    colors: ["green", "brown"]
    shape: "thin, elongated"
  - name: "Persian Silk Tree"
    colors: ["green", "pink", "white"]
    shape: "fluffy, cotton-like"
  - name: "Blue Vervain"
    colors: ["green", "purple"]
    shape: "clustered, small"
```


```sql
CREATE TABLE plants (
    name VARCHAR(255),
    colors VARCHAR(255),
    shape VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO plants (name, colors, shape) VALUES
('Common Eastern Bumblebee', 'green,purple', 'spherical, thistle-like'),
('Broad-winged Thistle', 'green,purple', 'spiky, spherical'),
('Johnsongrasses, millet', 'green,brown', 'thin, elongated'),
('Poeae', 'green,brown', 'thin, elongated'),
('Persian Silk Tree', 'green,pink,white', 'fluffy, cotton-like'),
('Blue Vervain', 'green,purple', 'clustered, small');
```


```py
const plants = [
    {name: "Common Eastern Bumblebee", colors: ["green", "purple"], shape: "spherical, thistle-like"},
    {name: "Broad-winged Thistle", colors: ["green", "purple"], shape: "spiky, spherical"},
    {name: "Johnsongrasses, millet", colors: ["green", "brown"], shape: "thin, elongated"},
    {name: "Poeae", colors: ["green", "brown"], shape: "thin, elongated"},
    {name: "Persian Silk Tree", colors: ["green", "pink", "white"], shape: "fluffy, cotton-like"},
    {name: "Blue Vervain", colors: ["green", "purple"], shape: "clustered, small"}
];

plants.forEach(plant => {
    console.log(`${plant.name}: Colors - ${plant.colors.join(", ")}, Shape - ${plant.shape}`);
});
```
